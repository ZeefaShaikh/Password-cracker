# Password Cracker üîê

Password Cracker is a simple, educational Python project designed to demonstrate password generation and basic cracking concepts so you can learn why strong passwords matter. The tool can generate strong random passwords and includes small demo routines (safe, limited-scope) that show how weak passwords can be discovered by brute-force or dictionary-style approaches ‚Äî intended strictly for learning and testing on your own data.

## Features
- Generate strong random passwords with configurable length (letters, digits, symbols).
- Small demo routines that illustrate brute-force and dictionary-style cracking for educational purposes only.
- Lightweight, single-file script so you can read and modify the code easily.
- Clear examples and options for beginners to learn about password security.

## Tech stack
This project is written in plain **Python 3** and uses only standard library modules (`random`, `string`, etc.), so there are no external dependencies unless you add optional features.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZeefaShaikh/Password-Cracker.git
Open the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd Password-Cracker
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
# mac / linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# windows (powershell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python password_cracker.py
Usage
When you run the script, you will be able to generate a strong password by choosing a length and options (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols). The demo cracking routines show how a simple brute-force or dictionary approach attempts to find short/weak passwords ‚Äî these demos are intentionally small and not optimized for real attacks. Use the tool to experiment with password strength and to learn which kinds of passwords are safer.

Example commands
Generate a password (interactive):

bash
Copy code
python password_cracker.py
Example (if script supports CLI flags‚Äîadapt if needed):

bash
Copy code
python password_cracker.py --generate --length 16
python password_cracker.py --demo brute-force --target weakpass
Educational note & responsible use
This repository exists for learning. Do not use the cracking code against accounts, systems, or data you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Always act ethically and follow the law.

Future enhancements
Add CLI argument parsing for more flexible usage.

Add a small GUI (Tkinter) for non-technical users.

Add optional wordlist-based demos (kept separate and small).

Add unit tests for core functions.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome. If you want to help, fork the repo, create a branch, make your changes, and open a pull request. Please keep changes small, document new features, and include examples or tests when appropriate.

Example workflow:

bash
